<UL>The author wrote Program 4.8 as a solution to the classic problem on page 
  104+, <A href="http://www.tsum.edu/~fstrickl/CIS549/443.htm">4.4.3 The 
  Sleeping Barber</A>.&nbsp; He noted that some of his information came from 
  ([41], Problems 17, 18 on pages 72-73):&nbsp; Andrew S. Tanenbaum, <U>Modern 
  Operating Systems</U>, Prentice-Hall, 1992. 
  <P>In order to execute the author's basic program, one must go to the author's 
  website and download the <A 
  href="http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~shartley/ConcProgJava/Semaphores/slba.java">slba.java</A> 
  program.&nbsp; It doesn't work, because it depends upon a number of unique 
  supporting classes which the author has <A 
  href="http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~shartley/ConcProgJava/bookJavaExamples.html">written</A>.&nbsp; 
  To determine what is needed, one must compile the program and see what the 
  error messages are.&nbsp; Then one must create a directory called 
  c:\LIB\UTILITIES\ and a second directory called c:\LIB\SYNCHRONIZATION.&nbsp; 
  The c:\LIB must be added to the path statement.&nbsp; In c:\LIB\UTILITIES, one 
  must download <A 
  href="http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~shartley/ConcProgJava/lib/Utilities/GetOpt.java">GetOpt.java</A>, 
  <A 
  href="http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~shartley/ConcProgJava/lib/Utilities/MyObject.java">MyObject.java</A>, 
  and <A 
  href="http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~shartley/ConcProgJava/lib/Utilities/Scheduler.java">Scheduler.java</A>.&nbsp; 
  In c:\LIB\SYNCHRONIZATION, one must download <A 
  href="http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~shartley/ConcProgJava/lib/Synchronization/BinarySemaphore.java">BinarySemaphore.java</A>, 
  <A 
  href="http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~shartley/ConcProgJava/lib/Synchronization/ConditionVariable.java">ConditionVariable.java</A>, 
  <A 
  href="http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~shartley/ConcProgJava/lib/Synchronization/CountingSemaphore.java">CountingSemaphore.java</A>, 
  <A 
  href="http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~shartley/ConcProgJava/lib/Synchronization/MessagePassing.java">MessagePassing.java</A>, 
  <A 
  href="http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~shartley/ConcProgJava/lib/Synchronization/MessagePassingRoot.java">MessagePassingRoot.java</A>, 
  <A 
  href="http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~shartley/ConcProgJava/lib/Synchronization/NotImplementedMethodException.java">NotImplementedMethodException.java</A>, 
  and <A 
  href="http://www.mcs.drexel.edu/~shartley/ConcProgJava/lib/Synchronization/Semaphore.java">Semaphore.java</A>.&nbsp; 
  All of these will compile except Semaphore.java which is looking for 
  WouldBlockException method.&nbsp; I have not been able to find a file for this 
  method.&nbsp; I am not sure what the author is attempting to do with such a 
  call. 
  <P>8 May 1999 Notes:&nbsp; I learned from the author that there is a zip file 
  that contains everything.&nbsp; I have downloaded it and unzipped it.&nbsp; I 
  found the missing file.&nbsp; Now the Java compiler can complete the whole 
  task.&nbsp; This exercise asks the student to execute the program.&nbsp; I 
  attempt to do that, but now the program won't execute.&nbsp; Turns out the 
  problem is that the author had a typo in the problem.&nbsp; One must type 
  "java SleepingBarber" instead of "java SleepingBarbers."&nbsp; It now executes 
  and yields similar results. 
  <P>I worked through the single barber program and then I changed the program 
  so it would run with two barbers.&nbsp; Visit <A

  link</A> for the single barber discussion.&nbsp; Visit <A
